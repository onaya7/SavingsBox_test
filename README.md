# Overview
The Task Manager App is a mobile application built using Flutter. It enables users to efficiently manage their daily tasks by providing features such as task creation, updates, deletion, categorization, due dates, and reminders. The app also includes user authentication and data synchronization with a remote database.

## Features
- User Authentication: Email/password sign-up, login, and password recovery using Firebase Authentication.

- Offline Support: Local data storage using Hive, with synchronization to Firebase Firestore when online.
- Responsive Design: Clean, adaptive UI with support for light and dark modes.

- Cross-Platform: Deployment-ready for both Android and iOS platforms.
